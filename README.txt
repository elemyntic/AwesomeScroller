This app contains the example Android ListView with the inclusion of a OnScrollListener 
that will play the "Europe - Final Countdown" mp3 from the assets folder when scrolling.

Special feature is the fade in - fade out of the volume on stop/start scroll.

Although not nearly as Jazzy os the Smooth Jazz Scrolling by Brian Bowden this 
OnScrollListener can be easily adapted to bring Jazz to other ListViews.
